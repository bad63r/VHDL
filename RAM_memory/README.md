# RAM memory
Simple RAM memory with one port for writing and one port for reading.

## Create project in Vivado with tcl script
Go to the directory where you downloaded the files(type `pwd` to see where you are and use `cd name_of_directory` to go to the destination).
In the Tcl console run: `source script.tcl`. It will set whole project for you :)
